# CACHE-ual CORNER

CACHE-ual CORNER is a chat room application created to helpÂ  connect, and express ideas in one common chatroom. Whether it is to discover that there are other people who share the same ideas or to spread new topics that have just occurred CACHE-ual CORNER is a place to discuss.


The idea became reality when a group of people sparked interest into revamping retro style chatting systems to the modern day world. CACHE-ual CORNER has a nostalgic feel of all the best chatting systems of the past, ICQ, AIM, and Yahoo! to be revived into CACHE-ual CORNER with font colors and avatars! Whether you want to learn more about that chatting time period or relive those glory days CACHE-ual CORNER is for you!
