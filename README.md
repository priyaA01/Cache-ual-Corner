# CACHE-ual CORNER
**GETTING STARTED**:
The program should run automatically.

If the program is not running automatically, please make sure you have all the prerequisites listed below.

**STATEMENT OF PURPOSE**:
CACHE-ual CORNER is a communication application created to helpÂ  connect, quickly transmit, and express ideas in one common chatroom. Whether it is to discover that there are other people who share the same ideas or to spread new topics that have just occurred CACHE-ual CORNER is a place to discuss.


The idea became reality when a group of people sparked interest into revamping retro style chatting systems to the modern day world. CACHE-ual CORNER has a nostalgic feel of all the best chatting systems of the past, ICQ, AIM, and Yahoo! to be revived into CACHE-ual CORNER with font colors and avatars! Whether you want to learn more about that chatting time period or relive those glory days CACHE-ual CORNER is for you!


CACHE-ual CORNER was created to showcases the use of Node, Express, MySQL, Model View Controller design pattern, Sequelize,  HTML, CSS, jQuery, JavaScript, user validation, and deployment via Heroku.

CACHE-UAL CORNER is a chat room application where users communicate with one another through text-based messages sorted by pull date from a Sequel database to create CACHE-ual CORNER. Learning to use bcrypt-nodejs for encrypting the passwords, passport to serialize and deserialize the user, and passport local for username and password for user authentication were technology hurdles.

CACHE-ual CORNER is a group effort to provide a polished UI and a chatting platform for the user. Currently, CACHE-ual CORNER is not moderated, so users can chat freely with the other occupants of the room.

CACHE-ual CORNER accommodates logged members in a chat session. Sign up is free and enables the user to communicate with other members. Users can personalize their chat scession by choosing different skins, font color, and avatars for a unique chat experience.
